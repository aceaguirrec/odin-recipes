        <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
        <p>In Levantine cuisine, kibbeh is usually made by pounding bulgur wheat together with meat into a fine paste and forming it into balls with toasted pine nuts and spices. It may also be layered and cooked on a tray, deep-fried, grilled, or served raw.[7] In Mesopotamian cuisine, versions with rice or farina are found.[8] Some recipes add semolina.[9]</p>
        <p>Kibbeh is considered to be a national dish of Lebanon and Syria,[10] and is a popular dish in the Levant. Versions are found in Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Palestine, Iraq, Iran, the Persian Gulf, Armenia, and Turkey,[4] and among Assyrian people.[11] It is also found throughout Latin American countries that received substantial numbers of immigrants from the Levant during the late 19th and early 20th centuries,[12] as well as parts of North America.[13]</p>
